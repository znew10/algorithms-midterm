# Zach Newton's Algorithms Midterm: Red-Black Tree

## Setup & Running
1. Download the repository
2. Navigate to the root folder of the project
3. Run `mkdir build && cd build` to create a build directory and navigate to it
4. Run `cmake .. && make` to create and execute the Makefile from the supplied CMakeLists
5. Run `./midterm`

## Medium Post:
1. A brief history or motivating example for why the new thing was needed.

The Red-Black Tree (RBT) was invented by Rudolf Bayer in 1972. However, the red and black colors weren't associated until 1978, when Leonidas J. Guibas and Robert Sedgewick published their paper, "A Dichromatic Framework for Balanced Trees." The RBT set out to improve upon the delete operation of the AVL tree, another balanced binary search tree.

2. An explanation with examples and graphics about how your selection operates and how it improves on the previous options or equivalent in std lib. You can use pseudocode in this example to explain the process, but don’t start off with a big chunk of code.



3. A walkthrough of some code examples demonstrating features, functionality, benefits of your selection.
